# Content Approval Workflow Demo

This demo illustrated using PowerShell-based Lambda functions in a [Amazon Step Functions]() workflow, to simulate a content approval system (for example, a user wanting to send a tweet must first send it for approval). The approval workflow consists of automated and manual steps. The manual step can take an indeterminate period of time (a human must perform the final approve/reject step on the content) so the workflow uses a continuation token and pauses while waiting for the final human approval, which is done by clicking generated links in an email. Once the user clicks the appropriate link the workflow 'wakes up' and performs the final task in the workflow to notify the original submitter of the decision.

The demo also illustrates invoking another Lambda function from within a Lambda - in this case to obtain the callback urls to place into the approve/reject email. This is done using the [sfn-callback-urls](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications/arn:aws:serverlessrepo:us-east-2:866918431004:applications~sfn-callback-urls) serverless application available from the [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications) to generate the approve/reject urls containing the continuation token.
