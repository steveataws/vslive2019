#==============================================================================
# Triggered when the workflow resumes after the approver has clicked the approve
# or reject links from the previous email. Sends a confirmation email to the
# approver of their actions. It is assumed a separate Lambda, or maybe even this
# one, could be added to notify the requester of the decision.
#
# Input to this function:
#   PSObject with 'requester' and 'content' fields.
#
# Environment parameters to customize this function:
#   none
#
# Parameter Store parameters used by this function:
#   /ContentApprovalWorkflow/EmailTopicArn
#       the SNS topic arn to which the confirmation will be sent. We assume
#       the requester is also subscribed to this topic to keep the demo simple!
#
#=============================================================================

# When executing in Lambda the following variables will be predefined.
#   $LambdaInput        A PSObject that contains the Lambda function input data.
#   $LambdaContext      An Amazon.Lambda.Core.ILambdaContext object that contains
#                       information about the currently running Lambda environment.
#
# The last item in the PowerShell pipeline will be returned as the result of the
# Lambda function.

# Note: we're using the new preview release of the AWS Tools for PowerShell here.
# The Lambda tooling doesn't currently follow the dependency chain so we have to be
# explicit and add the common module.
#Requires -Modules @{ModuleName='AWS.Tools.Common';ModuleVersion='3.3.618.0'}
